					Limestone Coves is the development that includes our “nearest neighbors” if you live or own property

					other Lake Limestone development which have privileges to use the Oak Point Boat Launch.</bold>
					Additionally, as our neighbors, we try to include you when we can with neighborhood activities, such
					as our July Fourth festivities. So, although this section is written with property/homeowners in
					Limestone Coves in mind, if you are a resident/property owner in Oak point and are just curious
					about the relationship with Limestone Coves, this section should answer your questions.

				  </header>

				<p>
					When you purchased your land or home in Limestone Coves you were probably told that property owners
					in this development have access to the “Oak Point Boat Launch”. That is absolutely true! Way back
					when the land around Lake Limestone was being developed and the two neighborhoods of Oak Point and
					Limestone Coves were established, the developers for these two areas shared the plot of land that
					adjoined these neighborhoods and they planned for this area to become a shared boat launch. Later
					the Boat Launch area was officially deeded to Oak Point exclusively, but all involved decided to
					honor the agreement that had been made early-on for both developments to be able to use the Launch.
				<br>
				<br>
					Property Owners in Oak Point also established a Homeowners Association (of sorts), or more
					accurately a neighborhood “civic association”. This is the Oak Point Civic Association (OPCA) and
					property/homeowners in Oak Point choose to be members of this organization and to pay annual dues.
					Depending on the needs in any given year, a portion of these dues go to maintaining and enhancing
					the Boat Launch.
				<br>
				<br>
					<bold>Limestone Coves property owners</bold> don’t pay dues per se <bold>but are asked to contribute to the Boat Launch
					fund annually. Contributing is optional, but most property owners do contribute the $25.00 that is
					requested, and many choose to contribute even more.</bold> The Oak Point Civic Association follows an
					October 1 – September 30th fiscal year. So annual dues for Oak Point property owners and boat launch
					contributions from Limestone Coves property owners are collected in the early Fall of each year.
					Reminder letters are generally sent out in October, but Limestone Coves property owners are welcome
					to be proactive and send these contributions forward in mid-late September. These can be sent to the
					OPCA Treasurer identified in other sections of this Web Page. <bold>It is also very helpful if you send
					your current contact information (names, email, phone number and mailing address) along with your
					contribution. This allows us to include you in all Boat Launch Info communication.</bold> So, for example
					if the Launch is being temporarily closed because of low water levels, you will be notified of this.

				  <h4>Limestone Coves and Oak Point Activities</h4>
				</header>
				<p>
					<bold>The OPCA provides a number of social and enrichment activities each year to OPCA members. Some of
					these activities are enjoyed by Limestone Coves as well.</bold> Generally, we are only able to share the
					events which are not funded by the OPCA. For example, we always make a point to extend the route of
					our Independence Day Parade so that at least some of our Limestone Coves neighbors can enjoy this
					traditional fun! We are also happy to have our Limestone Coves neighbors use our “Tiny Library”
					located at the Oak Point bulletin board. In the future we are hoping to invite Limestone Coves to
					join us for enrichment activities, such as guest speakers. if we have your Limestone Coves contact
					information, you will receive this information. If the event is funded by OPCA, you will be charged
					a small participation fee.
