				<p>Lake Limestone is a great slice of the best central Texas has to offer!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.brazos.org/About-Us/Reservoirs/Lake-Limestone/Online-Lake-Map">Lake Limestone</a> is located approximately 2.5 to 3 hours from Dallas, Houston and Austin and is 1 hour from
				Waco or College Station. Lake Limestone is a 13,680-acre reservoir within the Navasota River system
				which was built in 1978. The dam which created the lake is called Sterling Robertson Dam. The lakes
				waterfront area extends over 3 counties (Leon, Limestone, Robertson). The Oak Point Community is located
				in Robertson County. The depth of the lake at the dam is 43 feet. This is not a constant level lake as
				the water levels do fluctuate. Full level is designated as 363' elevation.
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.brazos.org/About-Us/Reservoirs/Lake-Limestone ">The Brazos River Authority</a> has jurisdiction over Lake Limestone. The lake was originally built and
				continues to serve as a “water supply” lake; in addition to its recreational function. The Brazos River
				Authority has established four public areas, scattered across Lake Limestone’s shorelines. These parks
				offer a variety of amenities, including boat launching ramps, camp sites, picnic tables and fishing
				piers.

			<p>
				<a href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/limestone/">Lake Limestone fishing</a> is some of the best among the central Texas lakes. Because it is located off the
				beaten path, anglers will find they have little competition, particularly during the week. Spring is the
				best time to catch good numbers of quality size largemouth bass, but these fish can be caught
				year-round. Three catfish species are present: blue, channel, and flathead, with channel catfish being
				the most common. Crappie and white bass fishing are also good in spring when these species spawn. Gently
				sloping banks, flooded timber, and an abundance and variety of aquatic vegetation offer anglers plenty
				of diverse cover to fish. Numerous boat houses and docks offer additional cover.
