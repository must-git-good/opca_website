				<p>
					As a property/home owner in the Oak Point Neighborhood on Lake Limestone in Texas you have the
					opportunity to be a member of the <a href="join_opca">Oak Point Civic Association (OPCA)</a>, The mission of this
					association is to enhance the Oak Point community through efforts to connect residents, protect
					community assets and enrich lives. It is the OPCA that brings you this Web Page. Although joining
					the OPCA is optional for all property/homeowners, your membership is strongly encouraged and very
					much appreciated!
				<br><br>
					The ”value-added” to all property/home owners in joining and participating with the OPCA is that by
					uniting in our efforts to improve and protect our community while also enriching lives we can build
					stronger bonds, increase comfort and improve security for each of us. Remember the famous saying,
					“United We Stand, Divided We Will Fall,” that approach holds true to our small, but very uniquely
					special neighborhood of “Oak Point” on Lake Limestone. We hope you choose to unite with us!
				<br><br>
					Whether or not you are a member of the OPCA, this section was constructed to provide you
					(property/homeowners) with valuable information about local resources to assist you in managing your
					property and making your lake life more enjoyable. Those visiting or residing in Oak Point typically
					utilize area towns and cities for resources.
