				<p>
					The Oak Point Civic Association exists for and is made up of property and homeowners of the Oak
					Point Neighborhood at Lake Limestone. <bold>The success of OPCA is totally dependent on memberships.</bold> The
					organization, and all the activities, events and improvements made by the organization, rely
					exclusively on membership dues for funding and support.
				</p>
				<section class=>
				<p>
					<bold>Joining OPCA is easy! All that is required is for you to send your annual $125.00 dues contribution
					to the current OPCA Treasurer each September or early October.</bold> You can send a check or money order
					made out to “Oak Point Civic Association”. The name and address of the current OPCA Treasurer is
					available through the Our Board section of this Web Page. <bold>The other option for joining or continuing
					your membership in OPCA is to bring your check or money order to the Annual Meeting of the OPCA Full
					Membership</bold> which is traditionally held the last Saturday in September.
				</p>
				</section>
				<p>
					Please be sure when you send the annual dues that you also send any changes that have been made to
					your contact information. We need to know if you have a new mailing address, email address or phone
					number so we can be sure to reach you with important information as needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<bold>If you are new to Oak Point, you can join the OPCA at any time during your first year as a
					property/homeowner.</bold> You can then get into the normal annual cycle when October 1 rolls around again.
				</p>
				<p>
					We look forward to having you as a member of the Oak Point Civic Association! A special “thank you”
					to those of you have consistently continued as active members of the OPCA! You are valued and
					appreciated!
