            include all the homes and lots accessible from the south side of the

            The development immediately adjacent to the Oak Point Neighborhood
            is officially known as Limestone Coves. Limestone Coves through
            written agreement has been granted utilization rights to the Oak
            Point Boat Launch. In order to help support the Boat Launch,
            Limestone Coves homeowners are given the opportunity each year to
            contribute to the OPCA Boat Launch Maintenance and Improvement Fund
            and many of these homeowners support this cause. Thank you Limestone
            Coves for your support and assistance!
