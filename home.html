					North Shores and Revised North Shores developments. These developments include all the homes and
					lots accessible from the south side of the “Oak Point” entrance sign.</p>

				<p>The Oak Point Boat Launch is a private boat launch owned by the Oak Point Civic Association. Only
					homeowners in the Oak Point Neighborhood or adjoining Limestone Coves are authorized to use the boat
					launch. All others are subject to towing and fines. There is no parking allowed in the Oak Point
					Boat

					<h4>Enrichment Activities</h4>
					<p>Because we never stop growing.
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>The OPCA Board of Directors and the Enrichment Committee coordinate and offer opportunities for
					residents
					and homeowners to come together with the goal of growing, developing and learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Available Enrichment Activities and/or Groups Include:<br />
					The Lakeside Readers Book Club, which meets on the fourth Thursday of most months. Lakeside Readers
					is
					facilitated by Barbara Casey and meets at the homes of different members for each meeting. For more
					information, please contact Barbara Casey at _____________________or __________________________.
				</p>
				<p>
					An Oak Point Tiny Library is available near the neighborhood Bulletin Board. This free library is
					managed by the Lakeside Readers Book Club and is designed around the “take a book, leave a book”
					philosophy. Homeowners, residents, and visitors to the Oak Point area utilize the Tiny Library.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are plans in the future to bring even more enrichment activities to Oak Point. Some of these
					may
					include providing speakers on topics of interest (attendance would be free for OPCA members with a
					small
					charge for non-members), or offering more club or group activities such as a crafters guild or
					gardening
					exchange. Look for more information on these in coming months!
