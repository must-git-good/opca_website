				  <h4>Oak Point Craft Fair</h4>
				</header>
				<p>
					The annual Oak Point Craft Fair is held in conjunction with other Independence Day Activities and gets
					underway immediately following the neighborhood parade. The Craft Fair is held in the open field between
					Turkal’s (11707 Lakeshore Dr.) and Shannon Dr.. Although this is a small craft fair, there have been a
					nice variety of vendors each year. In the past participant crafters’ merchandise has included such
					things as jewelry, knitted crafts, clocks, wooden porch swings, candles, potholders, and wall signs as
					well as canned foods, baked goods and lemonade.
	
					In addition to the available crafts, the fair also offers fun activities and arcade-type games for kids
					including face painting, sandbag and ring toss, and toy “fishing”. The activities vary from year to
					year… but children enjoy having entertainment while parents and grandparents browse the crafts!
	
					The craft fair is a great place to purchase unique items but also to mingle and enjoy the company of
					friends and neighbors. We hope you will all join us each year for this great event!
